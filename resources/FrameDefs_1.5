Delivery	Delivery :  a deliverer hands off a theme to a recipient or ( more indirectly ) a goal location , which is accessible to the recipient .
Deny_permission	Deny_permission :  in this frame , an authority orders a protagonist not to engage in an action .
Departing	Departing :  an object ( the theme ) moves away from a source . the source may be expressed or it may be understood from context , but its existence is always implied by the departing word itself .
Deserving	Deserving :  the existence of a state_of_affairs is sufficient reason for taking an action . the agent who is justified in taking the suggested action is not part of the immediate scene , however .
